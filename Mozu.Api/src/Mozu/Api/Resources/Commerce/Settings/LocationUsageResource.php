* Use the Location Usages resource to define the locations and location types that interact with the specified site. The system creates three default location usage types for each site after provisioning a new tenant - one for direct ship (DS), one for in-store pickup (SP), and one for store finder (storeFinder). Each site can only use a single location for the direct ship location usage type, and the location must support the direct ship fulfillment type (DS). For the in-store pickup location usage type, each site can use one or more location types. The location service identifies all locations of the specified type that support the in-store pickup fulfillment type (SP). For the store finder location usage type, each site can use one or more location types. The location service identifies all locations of the type. Locations configured for the store finder type do not typically maintain inventory. You cannot create additional location usage types at this time.
