Valid operators include equals (eq), does not equal (ne), greater than (gt), less than (lt), greater than or equal to (ge), less than or equal to (le), starts with (sw), or contains (cont). For example - "filter=IsDisplayed+eq+true"

	* @param string $responseFields Use this field to include those fields which are not included by default.
	* @param string $sortBy The element to sort the results by and the channel in which the results appear. Either ascending (a-z) or descending (z-a) channel. Optional. Refer to [Sorting and Filtering](../../../../Developer/api-guides/sorting-filtering.htm) for more information.
