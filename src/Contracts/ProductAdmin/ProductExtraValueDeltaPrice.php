For example, if a product with a defined monogram extra costs an additional $10, the `deltaPrice `value is "10". Between options, a price for a medium may be $10 and a large $12 giving a `deltaPrice `value of "2".Refer to [Product Variant Pricing and Weight](../../../guides/catalog/products.htm#product_variant_pricing_and_weight) in the Products guides topic for more information.
