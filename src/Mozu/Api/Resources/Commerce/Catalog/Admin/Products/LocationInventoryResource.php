Valid operators include equals (eq), does not equal (ne), greater than (gt), less than (lt), greater than or equal to (ge), less than or equal to (le), starts with (sw), or contains (cont). For example - "filter=IsDisplayed+eq+true"
	* @param int $pageSize The number of results to display on each page when creating paged results from a query. The maximum value is 200.
	* @param string $productCode Merchant-created code that uniquely identifies the product such as a SKU or item number. Once created, the product code is read-only.
	* @param string $responseFields Use this field to include those fields which are not included by default.
	* @param string $sortBy The property by which to sort results and whether the results appear in ascending (a-z) order, represented by ASC or in descending (z-a) order, represented by DESC. The sortBy parameter follows an available property. For example: "sortBy=productCode+asc"
	* @param int $startIndex When creating paged results from a query, this value indicates the zero-based offset in the complete result set where the returned entities begin. For example, with a PageSize of 25, to get the 51st through the 75th items, use startIndex=3.
